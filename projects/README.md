## 1. Hydrogen in a box 

[Here](https://code.itp.ac.cn/codes/hydrogen-data) you can find some pre-computed data for 64 hydrogen atoms in a box. There are six sets of data at different temperatures (T) and densities (rs). 

Try to set up a machine-learning model to learn the energy and pressure of the system. It makes sense you train on 1200K and 6000K data, and test on 3000K data. 



## 2. A generative model for alanine dipeptide

[Here](https://markovmodel.github.io/mdshare/ALA2/#alanine-dipeptide) you can find the trajectory file of the alanine dipeptide sample from molecular dynamics simulation. 

Please write a generative model to generate more configurations of the same molecule.  



## 3. Differentiable quantum control 

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0_sJMwmk7rbpxHMcBZwdD9pnYZx93oh?usp=sharing) is an example code to optimize the pulse to realize a particular quantum gate. 

You can either 

- work on the questions at the end of the notebook 
- or, explore your own idea building on the notebook. For example, adapt it to a more realistic Hamiltonian (Ryderberg atom, transmon, etc). 



## 4. Electrons in a quantum dot

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIlPo5CAjYrqWHeFEZrMlzWNCoNJ6_YP?usp=sharing) is an example code that carries variational free energy calculation for a few electrons in a quantum dot. 

You can either 

- work on the questions at the end of the notebook 
- or, explore your own idea building on the notebook. 



## 5. Paper QA

[Here](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa) is a tool allows you to ask questions about uploaded texts (PDF documents, code repos). 

Play around with it. Explain how it works. Do you find it useful ? 



## 6. Molecular Property Prediction

[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/champs-scalar-coupling/overview) is a competition on Kaggle. It's scientific ML with data: Use the data to develop an algorithm to predict the interaction between two atoms in a molecule. Background in DFT, MD would be helpful. 

You can either

- work on the competition and submit your results to the leaderboard.
-or, explore your own idea building on the existing competition.



## Lastly, welcome to bring your own project...

## Hydrogen in a box 

[Here](https://code.itp.ac.cn/codes/hydrogen-data) you can find some pre-computed data for 64 hydrogen atoms in a box. There are six sets of data at different temperatures (T) and densities (rs). 

Try to set up a machine-learning model to learn the energy and pressure of the system. It makes sense you train on 1200K and 6000K data, and test on 3000K data. 



## A generative model for alanine dipeptide

[Here](https://markovmodel.github.io/mdshare/ALA2/#alanine-dipeptide) you can find the trajectory file of the alanine dipeptide sample from molecular dynamics simulation. 

Please write a generative model to generate more configurations of the same molecule.  



## Differentiable quantum control 

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0_sJMwmk7rbpxHMcBZwdD9pnYZx93oh?usp=sharing) is an example code to optimize the pulse to realize a particular quantum gate. 

You can either 

- work on the questions at the end of the notebook 
- or, explore your own idea building on the notebook. For example, adapt it to a more realistic Hamiltonian (Ryderberg atom, transmon, etc). 



## Electrons in a quantum dot

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIlPo5CAjYrqWHeFEZrMlzWNCoNJ6_YP?usp=sharing) is an example code that carries variational free energy calculation for a few electrons in a quantum dot. 

You can either 

- work on the questions at the end of the notebook 

- or, explore your own idea building on the notebook. 

  

## Lastly, welcome to bring your own project...
